const String groupDescription = "Welcome to our data science project website! We are a team of computer science students who are passionate about using data science to extract insights. Our project focuses on analyzing tweets regarding Leni Robredo's allegiance with CPP-NDA-NDF. This was very prominent during the 2022 Philippine Presidential Elections. We are interested in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships within the data from tweets, and using this knowledge to make informed decisions. Together, we make a dynamic team that brings different perspectives and skills to the project. We are excited to share our findings and insights with you and hope that our project will inspire others to explore the fascinating world of data science.";

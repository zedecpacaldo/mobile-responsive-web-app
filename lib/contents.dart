Our project focuses on analyzing tweets regarding Leni Robredo's allegiance with CPP-NDA-NDF. This was very prominent during the 2022 Philippine Presidential Elections. We are interested in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships within the data from tweets, and using this knowledge to make informed decisions. Together, we make a dynamic team that brings different perspectives and skills to the project. We are excited to share our findings and insights with you and hope that our project will inspire others to explore the fascinating world of data science.";

                <strong>Handling outliers</strong>
                <p>For our project, we kept the outliers in our data specifically for the post by a media account. This is due to the fact that the media sample demonstrates a 'bias' of engagement. Despite the fact that the account has significant followers, it received a lot less engagement compared to tweets from anonymous and new accounts.</p>

                <strong>Ensuring formatting consistency (date, labels, etc.)</strong>
                <p>To ensure format consistency, dates were converted into datetime data types, specifically the columns ‚ÄòJoined‚Äô and ‚ÄòDate posted‚Äô. Also, for categorical data, we first check the unique values to see if there are misspelling and/or inconsistencies with the labels. Then, we use regex to correct these inconsistencies.</p>

                <p>Categorical data such as the Tweet Type, Account Type and Content type were encoded into numerical values. For tweet type, we added 7 more columns, one for each possible tweet type : Text, Reply (Quote Tweet), Reply (Comment), Image, Video, URL, and Link. The values in these columns are either 1 if it is under the corresponding tweet type and 0 if not. Similarly, for content type, we added 3 more columns: Emotional, Rational, and Transactional. The values are also either 1 or 0 depending if the tweet is categorized under the corresponding content type. Lastly, for the Account type, we set 1 for ‚ÄòAnonymous‚Äô, 2 for ‚ÄòIdentified‚Äô, and 3 for ‚ÄòMedia‚Äô.</p>

                <strong>Tokenization and lower casing</strong>
                <p>To effectively track what terms are most prevalent in the tweets collected about Former Vice President Leni Robredo's alleged ties with the CPP-NPA, we tokenized the 'Tweet' column of the dataset. In preparation for filtering stop words, stemming and lemmatization, before tokenization, each 'Tweet' column entry is converted to its lowercase form. This is also to avoid unnecessary repetitions for the succeeding processes.</p>

              <li>
                <strong>Stop words removal</strong>
                <p>The tweets collected featured both English and Tagalog words. We used the nltk.corpus English stop words for filtering out for the English parts. However, for the Tagalog parts, we came out with an incomplete list of Tagalog stop words. This is incomplete as Tagalog or Filipino stop words are very numerous and a stop word can take on different forms. For example, the word "iyon" can be "iyun", "yun", "yon", "yorn", etc. </p>

                <p>For stemming, we used PorterStemmer from nltk.stem and applied it on each token in token list entry in the Tweet column. For Lemmatization, we used the WordNetLemmatizer for the Tweet column and applied it similarly as Stemming.</p>

        <p>For data modeling, we are interested in relating the most engaged tweets with the behavior of the number of engagements per month. That being said, We extracted the top 5 liked, retweeted, and replied tweets and made projected them on different line plots to visually inspect their impacts to the behavior of the line. Does these high engaging posts directly influence the direction of the line? This is one of the few questions we will try to answer.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Analyzing the time series for the tweet likes per month, we can see that 9 out of the 10 most liked tweets directly create a further increase in the total number of likes of other posts. These engaging posts could be contributing to the further increase of engagement of other posts.</p>

        <p>Analyzing the time series for the tweet retweets per month, we can see that all of the most retweeted tweets directly create a further increase in the total number of likes of other posts. These engaging posts could be contributing to the further increase of engagement of other posts.</p>

These engaging posts could be contributing to the further increase of engagement of other posts.</p>
        <p>Overall, most of the top 10 engaging tweets positively reinforces the direction of engagement.</p><figure>

        </figure>
        <p>The t-test shows that the t-test value is -2.355, indicating that the mean of the first group (before announcement & after elections) is smaller than the mean of the second group (After announcement until last day of the campaign period). Furthermore, the t-test shows a p-value of 0.021 (< 0.05), indicating a statistically significant difference between the two groups.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        
        <p>Reject Null Hypothesis. There is a significant difference in the amount of fake news tweets before Leni Robredo‚Äôs announcement of presidential candidacy and after the elections and after her announcement until the last day of the Official Campaign period. There is also an increase in engagement (likes, retweets, and replies) for tweets posted after Robredo‚Äôs announcement until the last day of the Official Campaign period, suggesting an increased public interest on Leni-related tweets and/or a massive disinformation campaign against Leni Robredo‚Äôs political pact.</p>
        
        <h2>Recommendation</h2>
        <p>Recommendations include increased number of entries, integration of sentiment analysis for determining language patterns, and identify more specific events during the election period that cause local and global spikes in the amount of disinformation tweets and their engagement.</p>
